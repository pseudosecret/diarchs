# What's going on here??

I'm putting together Wilbur Industries and the various subpages, 
e.g., Democracy, a blog, etc. #StillTrying

## Things to do!

Okay, so like... let's take a look.

* Wilbur bros login
    * Develop login page
    * Limit account creation to one admin account
    * Create sessions and cookies that track login
    * Hide/display pages based on login
* Setup redirect for webring for nonsense beyond '/'
* Create image upload for blog posts
    * Part of the form that allows you to upload images
    * Ability to choose from previously uploaded images
* Search page for blogs and creative writing entries
    * Design the search criteria
    * Design the search page
    * For now, display all entries on the search page
* Create pagination for the searched entries

* Develop contact form (and related) so it
    * Collects comments from users
    * Displays comments from users
    * Provides the ability to delete unwanted comments
* All of Democracy

### This looks like just a blog; what's the point of this?

The main point is the Democracy web app. I've been dreaming about
it for a solid while. It's what I call a "macro-game", where
play is influenced by all other players.

It works as follows:
* Players are assigned one of two teams
* Players vote, once per day, one one of the following shapes:
    * Rock
    * Paper
    * Scissors
* Players accrue points based on the outcome of the votes for that day
* Players can spend points to:
    * Increase their team's points
    * Reduce the enemy team's points
* The first team to a threshold of a certain amount wins


That's it for now! *Yay!*
